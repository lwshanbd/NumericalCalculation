@article{Veiga2018,
abstract = {Would consumer surplus increase if annuity rates were age-neutral? This paper characterizes the socially optimal contractibility of a given signal in markets with adverse selection. A signal (e.g., age) partitions consumers into subsets (e.g., young and old). A regulator restricts price-discrimination on the basis of the signal if the consumer subsets where the level of cost is higher are also the subsets where there is greater deadweight loss due to adverse selection. Such signals are empirically common. To illustrate the welfare benefit of price discrimination policy, I use a structural model to estimate its impact on the UK annuities market. The model is estimated using proprietary data that include the annuity seller's estimate of each individual's longevity. I find that restricting price discrimination can increase consumer surplus by the equivalent of about {\pounds}6.5 million per year.},

@article{Chen2018,
abstract = {We use data from a major peer-to-peer lending marketplace in China to study whether female and male investors evaluate loan performance differently. Controlling for variables of investor demographics, investor experience, and loan characteristics, we find that loans invested by female investors are more likely to default and have lower loan return in the future than loans invested by male investors. We define abnormal default or abnormal loan return as the part of the loan default or the part of loan return that is not explained by loan characteristics and find that the loans invested by female investors have higher abnormal default and lower abnormal loan return than the loans invested by male investors. Furthermore, female investors perform similarly to male investors in abnormal default or abnormal loan return when investors have high levels of education or income or when investors work in finance or information technology industries.},

@article{Havrylchyk2018,
abstract = {The objective of our paper is to explore the role of P2P lending platforms through the prism of the theory of financial intermediation. P2P lending platforms perform the brokerage function of financial intermediaries by matching lenders' supply and borrowers' demand of funding, according to the risk and the maturity of their needs. Unlike banks, P2P lending platforms do not create money and do not perform risk and maturity transformation. However, they can organize secondary markets to trade loan contracts before maturity and some P2P lending platforms aim at providing a fixed income to lenders. To ensure efficient and sustainable financial intermediation, P2P lending platforms need to ensure that they are not subject to principal-agent problems and that their incentives coincide with those of lenders. The possibility of orderly resolution of P2P lending platforms failures might decrease moral hazard problems that are inherent in the modern financial intermediation.},
